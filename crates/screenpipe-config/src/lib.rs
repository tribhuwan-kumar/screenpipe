//! Shared recording configuration for screenpipe.
//!
//! This crate defines [`RecordingSettings`], the single source of truth for
//! recording/capture configuration shared by the desktop app, CLI, and engine.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! App (store.bin)  ──► RecordingSettings ──► engine
//! CLI (args/TOML)  ──► RecordingSettings ──► engine
//! ```
//!
//! The desktop app wraps `RecordingSettings` inside its `SettingsStore`
//! (via `#[serde(flatten)]`) alongside UI-only fields like shortcuts and
//! AI presets. The CLI builds `RecordingSettings` from command-line args
//! or a TOML config file. Both paths produce the same type that the
//! engine consumes.
